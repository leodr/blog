          After finishing or achieving something great, one may be tempted to
          stay in the flow and start with the next thing. However I think taking
          a break is important.

          You appreciate your achievements more if you take the time off. When
          just finished, you still have the work view of your result. You notice
          little things that could have been better. You may even be
          self-concious about it.
        </p>

          Only after taking some time off you see the project as a whole and are
          able to fully appreciate the work, even if not perfect. When you start
          to focus on the next thing immediately, you will always have the
          finished project in mind as "could have been better".
