              As tools aiding the creative process become better, the advantage
              one human has in crafting a specific output diminishes. While
              today, one designer might have an advantage over another by being
              better at turning an idea into reality, that advantage will get
              smaller and smaller as better tools are developed and more people
              get access to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              So while this edge gets smaller and smaller, the differentiating
              factor becomes having better ideas. Idea finding may also be aided
              by technology down the road, so what's left is differentiating an
              idea worth pursuing from one thats not.
            </p>
            <p>
              So in the future, one person will probably produce better artwork,
              text or iconography, solely by having <i>better</i> taste than
              another.
            </p>
            <p>
              What <i>better</i> taste then means is another question. Maybe
              having a better feel for what current trends are. Maybe having a
              taste that's more aligned with what everybody else likes. Or maybe
              just having a taste that comes into fashion out of luck.
            </p>
            <p>
              But currently I'm sceptical of learning the craft of creating
              digital output. Learning to illustrate, learning to design
              iconography or learning to build 3D worlds might not be
              (technical) skills worth pursuing.
            </p>
            <p>
              What's left to pursue then is the skill of learning to brainstorm
              new ideas and getting deep into a topic, so you can start
              developing what's called a taste.
