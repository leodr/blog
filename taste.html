      <h1>Taste over Skill</h1>

          As tools aiding the creative process become better, the advantage one
          human has in crafting a specific output deminishes. While today, one
          designer might have an advantage over another by being better at
          turning an idea into reality, that advantage will get smaller and
          smaller as better tools are developed and more people get access to
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So while this edge gets smaller and smaller, the differentiating
          factor becomes having better ideas. Idea finding may also be aided by
          technology down the road, so what's left is differentiating an idea
          worth pursuing from one thats not.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in the future, one person will probably produce better artwork,
          text or iconography, solely by having <i>better</i> taste than
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          What <i>better</i> taste then means is another question. Maybe having
          a better feel for what current trends are. Maybe having a taste that's
          more aligned with what everybody else likes. Or maybe just having a
          taste that comes into fashion out of luck.
        </p>
        <p>
          But currently I'm sceptical of learning the craft of creating digital
          output. Learning to illustrate, learning to design iconography or
          learning to build 3D worlds might not be (technical) skills worth
          pursuing.
        </p>
        <p>
          What's left to pursue then is the skill of learning to brainstorm new
          ideas and getting deep into a topic, so you can start developing
          what's called a taste.
