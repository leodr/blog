    <h1>Real Worlds</h1>
    <p>
      The metaverse is a real world. It does not matter that the objects in it
      are not real, what does matter is that the people in it are real and the
      experiences you can have in it are.
    </p>
    <p>
      It currently only provides shallow experiences, as there is very limited
      display of human emotions and real behavior. But that is only a
      technological hurdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Improvements in technology will bring the spectrum closer and closer to
      the point where human interaction can feel totally natural. You will see
      other people's emotions on their faces, people will be able to move around
      freely and you will be able to hear people around you naturally like you
      would in real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while it may never be able to convey the feel of touching another
      person and it will never replace real life, it enables an incredible
      amount of new worlds to explore.
    </p>

      I quite like the Black Mirror episode "San Junipero". It shows people
      going to a digital place called San Junipero, which resembles a beach
      resort in the 1980s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people go there to party and enjoy their lives just like on vacation.
      It is a place where highly advanced technology takes people to a simpler
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may not be real, but the experiences people make in the episode are,
      very so. As for myself, I'd sometimes like to go to a place much simpler
      than today, where there is no social media, no LinkedIn, nobody to
      impress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is just such a real and intense experience, just meeting people and
      taking them for who they want to be, without the internet, just a real
      connection by being at the same place.
    </p>
    <p>That's something I'd like to see in the world.</p>
